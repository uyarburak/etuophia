    ~ What is Etuophia?

      A SQLite and Flask powered piazza clone

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the etuophia.py file or
         export an ETUOPHIA_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. install the app from the root of the project directory

         sudo pip install -U distribute --editable .

      3. tell flask about the right application:

         export FLASK_APP=etuophia

      4. fire up a shell and run this:

         flask initdb

      5. if you do not want to deal with a empty database run this also:

         flask populatedb

      6. now you can run etuophia:

         flask run

         the application will greet you on
         http://localhost:5000/
